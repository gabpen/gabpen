Welcome to my personal repository! Here you’ll find a collection of my data science projects, visual tools, and research explorations across topics in economics, development, and applied data analysis.

## About Me

I’m a Research Analyst and Data Scientist with a background in economics and a passion for transforming complex data into tools that support real-world decision-making. I hold a Master's in Development Economics and am currently completing a second Master's in Data Science at the UC Chile.

My work focuses on developing analytical tools, predictive models, and evidence-based insights using Python, Stata, R, SQL, and statistical methods. I enjoy working with diverse datasets—from macroeconomic indicators to satellite imagery—and translating them into actionable analysis.
